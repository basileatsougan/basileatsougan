Hi there 👋, I'm Basile Atsougan
I’m a software engineer with 03+ years of experience, passionate about building impactful solutions across different platforms, from web to mobile. Here’s a bit about what I’m up to:

🚀 Exploring: React Native & Python (django) & AI-powered applications
🎓 Currently learning: Diving deeper into cybersecurity.
🤝 Looking to collaborate on: Chatbots for small businesses, AI apps, and mobile applications.
🛠️ Building: A church music app, an AI app that summarizes great books, and a car rental website with integrated booking and payment systems.
💡 Fun fact: I once turned a $350 trading capital into $1,000 before experimenting with different strategies!
